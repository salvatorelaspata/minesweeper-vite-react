# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Usage

Run development environment with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> This command start vite project in web browser

Run decktop application with:

```bash
npm start
```

> This command start vite project in socketsupply runtime

Build for production with:

```bash
npm run build
```

> This command builds the project for web deployment with PWA support
